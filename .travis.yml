  # Right now we're using Docker, which only has Python 2 installed by default. Over time we can certainly create a more complicated docker that has multiple versions of Python installed, and programmatically determine which one to use

# Command to install dependencies
install:
  - docker pull climbsrocks/auto_ml_tests:latest
  - pip install coveralls

# Command to run tests
script: docker run -v $PWD:/tmp/working -w=/tmp/working --rm -it climbsrocks/auto_ml_tests:latest python setup.py nosetests

after_success:
  - docker cp climbsrocks/auto_ml_tests:latest:/.coverage
  - coveralls
